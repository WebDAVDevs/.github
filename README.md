# WebDAV developers community

The WebDAV protocol has a good potential but it also needs for a lot of improving and development.
It's almost stalled and no really active discussions are happening. The official website webdav.org didn't updated in a while.

You can join the organization and share your projects under its umbrella.
It will help others to find it. Also, you may ask for help from other developers.

Send a mail to stokito@gmail.com and I'll add you.
